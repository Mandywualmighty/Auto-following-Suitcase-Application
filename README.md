# Auto-following Suitcase Application
This application is designed to show how to develop an **Auto-following Suitcase** using embARC.A person holding a tag in hand,three ultra-wideband anchors should be installed inside the suitcase in an equilateral triangular shape with a side length of 20cm. The distance information measured by the UWB module is transmitted to EMSK through UART.Based on the principle of three-point positioning,the azimuth between the person and the suitcase can be obtained to achieve following.This suitcase can also monitor ambient temperature and air conditions.When the distance between the trunk and the owner exceed the preset ,the trunk will stop automatically,and then sound the alarm or call the mobile phone, so you don't have to worry about losing the trunk.This design is mainly suitable for flat and open indoor applications such as airport waiting halls.

### Required Software
- Metaware or ARC GNU Toolset
- Serial port terminal, such as putty, tera-term or minicom

### Hardware Connection
1. The EMSK implement **Auto-folowing** smart device, it will process the data returned by positioning module and ultrasonic sensor,and send instructions to motor driver module.It can also monitor temperature and dust concentration of air,we can view these data on OLED. 
   - Connect **Positioning module** to **J1**(Using UART interface), connect **Motor driver module** to **J3** and **J6**,connect **Ultrasonic sensor** to **J1** and **J3**.
   - Connect **PMOD TMP2** to **J4**(Using IIC interface), connect **ZPH01** to **J5**(Using uart interface),connect **OLED** and **GPRS** to **J2**(Using IIC interface),connect **Buzzer** to **J6**.
2. Configure your EMSKs with proper core configuration.

		#
		# root dir of embARC
		#
		EMBARC_ROOT = ../../..
		MID_SEL = common u8glib


See [ embARC Example User Guide][40], **"Options to Hard-Code in the Application Makefile"** for more detailed information about **Makefile Options**.
